collective.recipe.backup is basically a port of ye olde instancemanager_'s
backup functionality. That backup functionality was coded mostly by Reinout
van Rees and Maurits van Rees, both from `Zest software`_

Creating the buildout recipe was done by Reinout_ with some fixes by Maurits_.

The snapshotrestore script was added by Nejc Zupan (`niteoweb
<http://www.niteoweb.com>`_).
