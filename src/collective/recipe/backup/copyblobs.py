    Source is usually something like var/blobstorage and destination

    create a subdirectory with a fresh blob backup from the source.

    We can make a full backup or a partial backup.  Partial backups
    are done with rsync and hard links to safe disk space.  Actually,
    full backups used to avoid the hard links, but that did not really
    have any extra value, so now it does the same thing, just in its
    own directory.

    With 'use_rsync' at the default True, we use rsync to copy,
    otherwise we use shutil.copytree.  This is mostly there for
    systems that don't have rsync available.  rsync is recommended.

    Note that we end up with something like var/blobstorage copied to
    var/blobbackups/blobstorage.0/blobstorage.  We could copy the
    contents of var/blobstorage directly to blobstorage.0, but then
    the disk space safing hard links do not work.

    keep_blob_days only makes sense in combination with full=False.
    We then use this to keep the backups created in the last
    'keep_blob_days' days.  For full backups we use 'keep' to simply
    keep the last X backups.  But for partial backups 'keep' should
    mean we keep the last X full Data.fs backups plus the partial
    backups created by repozo; and there is no similar concept in our
    blobstorage backups.

    With timestamps True, we do not make blobstorage.0, but use timestamps,
    for example blobstorage.2017-01-02-03-04-05.
