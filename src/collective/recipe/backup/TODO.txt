* We could be smarter about restoring blobs to a specific point in
  time (pick the first blob backup with a modification date after the
  requested time), but it may be safer not to try to be too smart
  here.  Then again, if you restore a Data.fs from before the last
  zeopack then you need a blob backup from before that last zeopack
  too.
