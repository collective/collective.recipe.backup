1.1 (2009-08-21)
================

- Run the cleanup script (removing too old backups that we no longer
  want to keep) for additional file storages as well.
  Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/collective.buildout/+bug/408224
  [maurits]

- Moved everything into a src/ subdirectory to ease testing on buildbot (which
  would grab all egss in the eggs/ dir that buildbot's mechanism creates.
  [reinout]


1.0 (2009-02-06)
================

- Quote all paths and arguments so that it works on paths that contain
  spaces (specially on Windows). [sidnei]


0.9 (2008-12-05)
================

- Windows path compatibility fix.  [Juan A. Diaz]


0.8 (2008-09-23)
================

- Changed the default for gzipping to True. Adding ``gzip = true`` to all our
  server deployment configs gets tired pretty quickly, so doing it by default
  is the best default. Stuff like this needs to be changed **before** a 1.0
  release :-) [reinout]

- Backup of additional databases (if you have configured them) now takes place
  before the backup of the main database (same with restore). [reinout]


0.7 (2008-09-19)
================

- Added $BACKUP-style enviroment variable subsitution in addition to the tilde
  expansion offered by 0.6. [reinout, idea by Fred van Dijk]


0.6 (2008-09-19)
================

- Fixed the test setup so both bin/test and python setup.py test
  work. [reinout+maurits]

- Added support for ~ in path names. And fixed a bug at the same time that
  would occur if you call the backup script from a different location than
  your buildout directory in combination with a non-absolute backup
  location. [reinout]


0.5 (2008-09-18)
================

- Added support for additional_filestorages option, needed for for instance a
  split-out catalog.fs. [reinout]

- Test setup fixes. [reinout+maurits]


0.4 (2008-08-19)
================

- Allowed the user to make the script more quiet (say in a cronjob)
  by using 'bin/backup -q' (or --quiet).  [maurits]

- Refactored initialization template so it is easier to change.  [maurits]


0.3.1 (2008-07-04)
==================

- Added 'gzip' option, including changes to the cleanup functionality that
  treats .fsz also as a full backup like .fs. [reinout]

- Fixed typo: repoze is now repozo everywhere... [reinout]


0.2 (2008-07-03)
================

- Extra tests and documentation change for 'keep': the default is to keep 2
  backups instead of all backups. [reinout]

- If debug=true, then repozo is also run in --verbose mode. [reinout]


0.1 (2008-07-03)
================

- Added bin/restore. [reinout]

- Added snapshot backups. [reinout]

- Enabled cleaning up of older backups. [reinout]

- First working version that runs repozo and that creates a backup dir if
  needed. [reinout]

- Started project based on zopeskel template. [reinout]
