1.8 (unreleased)
================

- Also find filestorage file located in its own directory as created by
  collective.recipe.filestorage.
  [kleist]

- Factor out the construction of the path for filestorage file
  to a new helper function.
  [kleist]


1.7 (2010-12-10)
================

- Fix generated repozo commands to work also
  when recipe is configured to have a non **Data.fs**
  main db plus additional filestorages.
  e.g.:
  datafs= var/filestorage/main.fs
  additional = catalog
  [hplocher]

1.6 (2010-09-21)
================

- Added the option enable_snapshotrestore so that the creation of the
  script can be removed. Backwards compatible, if you don't specify it
  the script will still be created. Rationale: you may not want this
  script in a production buildout where mistakenly using
  snapshotrestore instead of snapshotbackup could hurt.
  [fredvd]


1.5 (2010-09-08)
================

- Fix: when running buildout with a config in a separate directory
  (like ``bin/buildout -c conf/prod.cfg``) the default backup
  directories are no longer created inside that separate directory.
  If you previously manually specified one of the location,
  snapshotlocation, or datafs parameters to work around this, you can
  probably remove those lines.  So: slightly saner defaults.
  [maurits]


1.4 (2010-08-06)
================

- Added documentation about how to get the required bin/repozo script
  in your buildout if for some reason you do not have it yet (like on
  Plone 4 when you do not have a zeo setup).
  Thanks to Vincent Fretin for the extra buildout lines.
  [maurits]


1.3 (2009-12-08)
================

- Added snapshotrestore script.  [Nejc Zupan]


1.2 (2009-10-26)
================

- The part name is now reflected in the created scripts and var/ directories.
  Originally bin/backup, bin/snapshotbackup, bin/restore and var/backups
  plus var/snapshotbackups were hardcoded.  Those are still there when you
  name your part ``[backup]``.  With a part named ``[NAME]``, you get
  bin/NAME, bin/NAME-snapshot, bin/NAME-restore and var/NAMEs plus
  var/NAME-snapshots.  Request by aclark for plone.org.  [reinout]


1.1 (2009-08-21)
================

- Run the cleanup script (removing too old backups that we no longer
  want to keep) for additional file storages as well.
  Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/collective.buildout/+bug/408224
  [maurits]

- Moved everything into a src/ subdirectory to ease testing on buildbot (which
  would grab all egss in the eggs/ dir that buildbot's mechanism creates.
  [reinout]


1.0 (2009-02-06)
================

- Quote all paths and arguments so that it works on paths that contain
  spaces (specially on Windows). [sidnei]


0.9 (2008-12-05)
================

- Windows path compatibility fix.  [Juan A. Diaz]


0.8 (2008-09-23)
================

- Changed the default for gzipping to True. Adding ``gzip = true`` to all our
  server deployment configs gets tired pretty quickly, so doing it by default
  is the best default. Stuff like this needs to be changed **before** a 1.0
  release :-) [reinout]

- Backup of additional databases (if you have configured them) now takes place
  before the backup of the main database (same with restore). [reinout]


0.7 (2008-09-19)
================

- Added $BACKUP-style enviroment variable subsitution in addition to the tilde
  expansion offered by 0.6. [reinout, idea by Fred van Dijk]


0.6 (2008-09-19)
================

- Fixed the test setup so both bin/test and python setup.py test
  work. [reinout+maurits]

- Added support for ~ in path names. And fixed a bug at the same time that
  would occur if you call the backup script from a different location than
  your buildout directory in combination with a non-absolute backup
  location. [reinout]


0.5 (2008-09-18)
================

- Added support for additional_filestorages option, needed for for instance a
  split-out catalog.fs. [reinout]

- Test setup fixes. [reinout+maurits]


0.4 (2008-08-19)
================

- Allowed the user to make the script more quiet (say in a cronjob)
  by using 'bin/backup -q' (or --quiet).  [maurits]

- Refactored initialization template so it is easier to change.  [maurits]


0.3.1 (2008-07-04)
==================

- Added 'gzip' option, including changes to the cleanup functionality that
  treats .fsz also as a full backup like .fs. [reinout]

- Fixed typo: repoze is now repozo everywhere... [reinout]


0.2 (2008-07-03)
================

- Extra tests and documentation change for 'keep': the default is to keep 2
  backups instead of all backups. [reinout]

- If debug=true, then repozo is also run in --verbose mode. [reinout]


0.1 (2008-07-03)
================

- Added bin/restore. [reinout]

- Added snapshot backups. [reinout]

- Enabled cleaning up of older backups. [reinout]

- First working version that runs repozo and that creates a backup dir if
  needed. [reinout]

- Started project based on zopeskel template. [reinout]
