# -*-doctest-*-

Advanced usage: multiple Data.fs files
======================================

Just to isolate some test differences, we run an empty buildout once::

    >>> ignore = system(buildout)

Add mock ``bin/repozo`` script::

    >>> import sys
    >>> write('bin', 'repozo',
    ...       "#!%s\nimport sys\nprint ' '.join(sys.argv[1:])" % sys.executable)
    >>> dontcare = system('chmod u+x bin/repozo')

Create var directory::

    >>> mkdir('var')

Sometimes, a Data.fs is split into several files. Most common reason is to
have a regular Data.fs and a catalog.fs which contains the
portal_catalog. This is supported with the ``additional_filestorages``
option::

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... newest = false
    ... parts = backup
    ...
    ... [backup]
    ... recipe = collective.recipe.backup
    ... additional_filestorages =
    ...     catalog
    ...     another
    ...     foo/bar
    ... """)

The additional backups have to be stored separate from the ``Data.fs``
backup. That's done by appending the file's name and creating extra backup
directories named that way::

    >>> print system(buildout) # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
    Installing backup.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/backup'.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/fullbackup'.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/snapshotbackup'.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/restore'.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/snapshotrestore'.
    <BLANKLINE>
    >>> ls('var')

The various backups are done one after the other. They cannot be done at the
same time with repozo. So they are not completely in sync. The "other"
databases are backed up first as a small difference in the catalog is just
mildly irritating, but the other way around users can get real errors::

    >>> print system('bin/backup')
    --backup -f /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/catalog.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/backups_catalog --gzip
    --backup -f /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/another.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/backups_another --gzip
    --backup -f /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/foo/bar.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/backups_foo/bar --gzip
    --backup -f /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/Data.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/backups --gzip

Same with snapshot backups::

    >>> print system('bin/snapshotbackup')
    --backup -f /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/catalog.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/snapshotbackups_catalog -F --gzip
    --backup -f /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/another.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/snapshotbackups_another -F --gzip

    INFO: Please wait while making snapshot backup: /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/Data.fs to /sample-buildout/var/snapshotbackups

And a restore restores all three backups::

    >>> print system('bin/restore', input='yes\n')
    --recover -o /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/catalog.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/backups_catalog
    --recover -o /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/another.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/backups_another
    --recover -o /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/foo/bar.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/backups_foo/bar
    --recover -o /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/Data.fs -r /sample-buildout/var/backups
    <BLANKLINE>
    This will replace the filestorage:
        /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/catalog.fs
        /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/another.fs
        /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/foo/bar.fs
        /sample-buildout/var/filestorage/Data.fs
    Are you sure? (yes/No)?

We fake three old backups in all the (snapshot)backup directories to
test if the 'keep' parameter is working correctly.

    >>> import os
    >>> import time
    >>> next_mod_time = time.time() - 1000
    >>> def add_backup(dir, name):  # same as in the tests in repozorunner.py
    ...     global next_mod_time
    ...     write(dir, name, 'sample fs')
    ...     # Change modification time, every new file is 10 seconds older.
    ...     os.utime(join(dir, name), (next_mod_time, next_mod_time))
    ...     next_mod_time += 10
    >>> dirs = ('var/backups', 'var/snapshotbackups')
    >>> for tail in ('', '_catalog', '_another', '_foo/bar'):
    ...     for dir in dirs:
    ...         dir = dir + tail
    ...         for i in reversed(range(3)):
    ...             add_backup(dir, '%d.fs' % i)
    >>> ls('var/backups')  # Before
    -  0.fs
    -  1.fs
    -  2.fs
